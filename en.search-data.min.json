Previously, I wrote a lot of documentation about using Jitsi and Vosk, however, it was stored in a different format and different application. I am working (as of sept 2021) to port those docs to this site in my free time.  Welcome!\nHere you will find step by step instructions on how to set up Jitsi Meet (with transcription using Vosk) for Linux machines (I mostly tested things on Debian, but Ubuntu should work too)\nI wrote these instructions keeping in mind what a beginner version of myself (non-Linux user, completely naive about Jitsi and Vosk) would have appreciated. It took me roughly two months to figure out how to use and modify Jitsi, Jigasi, and Vosk, given my inexperience with software development and the meh documentation for Jitsi and Vosk that was available at the time (summer 2021).\nHopefully, you find these helpful.\n- AK\n"},{"id":13,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"Step by Step Dev","content":""}]
