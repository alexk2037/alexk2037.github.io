**What does the author have?**

I have:
* a 2017 HP laptop running Windows 10 Home edition (64-bit)
* i5 Intel processor
* 8 GB of RAM

I have also [enabled virtualization in my BIOS](https://2nwiki.2n.cz/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=75202968) (necessary) and have [WSL2 enabled](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fntjriRe48) (not necessary, but convenient for me)

## VirtualBox
