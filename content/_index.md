Welcome! 

Here you will find step by step instructions on how to set up Jitsi Meet (with transcription) inside a VirtualBox virtual machine running Ubuntu 18.04 Server.

I wrote these instructions keeping in mind what a beginner version of myself would have appreciated.

Hopefully, you find these helpful.
